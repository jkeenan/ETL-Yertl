    filter, then writes the results to STDOUT.

ARGUMENTS
  filter
    See "FILTER SYNTAX".

OPTIONS
FILTER SYNTAX
    .   Returns the entire document, unfiltered. Useful in if/then
        statements.

            # INPUT
            foo: bar
            baz: fuzz

            $ yq .
            foo: bar
            baz: fuzz

    .key
        Extract a single key out of a hash document.

            # INPUT
            foo: bar
            baz: fuzz

            $ yq .foo
            bar

    if lhs_filter eq rhs_filter then filter
        If the lhs filter and rhs_filter are equal, return the then filter.

        For example

            # INPUT
            foo: bar
            baz: fuzz

            $ yq 'if .foo eq bar then .baz'
            fuzz

    Values
        Any bareword that is not recognized as a syntax element is treated
        as a value.
